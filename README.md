## UIDAI Data Freshness & Citizen Enablement Platform

Aadhaar Drishti is a data‑driven analytical and citizen‑centric platform designed to improve **Aadhaar data freshness, usability, and service reliability**. Developed as part of the **UIDAI Hackathon**, the platform analyzes **Aadhaar enrolment and update datasets** to generate actionable insights for administrators while enabling citizens to verify and update their Aadhaar information through a guided interface.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

While Aadhaar has achieved near‑universal coverage, **outdated demographic and biometric information** remains a major challenge. Factors such as internal migration, ageing population, and mobile number changes lead to:
- Authentication failures  
- Delays in availing government benefits  
- Silent exclusion from welfare schemes  

The need is to shift focus from *coverage* to **data freshness and functional usability**.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**Aadhaar Drishti** provides a **two‑panel system**:

1. **Admin / Government Dashboard**  
   An analytics platform for officials to identify high‑risk districts, age groups, and Aadhaar update gaps using aggregated data.

2. **Citizen Portal**  
   A user‑friendly interface where citizens can voluntarily check Aadhaar data freshness, receive AI‑driven guidance, and initiate updates.

All processing is done on **aggregated and anonymized datasets**, ensuring privacy and compliance.
